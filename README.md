<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Description">Wikipedia description</span></h2>

<p>The game is played on four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_(spatial_index)" title="Grid (spatial index)">grids</a>, two for each player. The grids are typically square – usually 10×10 – and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number. On
    one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid the player records his/her own shots.</p>
<p>Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type
    of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. These may vary depending on the rules.</p>
<p>There are two typical complements of ships, as given in the Milton Bradley version of the rules:</p>

<p>After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied
    by a ship, and if it is a "miss", the player marks their primary grid with a white peg; if a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid with a red peg. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own "tracking" grid with the appropriate
    color peg (red for "hit", white for "miss"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.</p>
<p>When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner announces this (e.g. "You sank my battleship!"). If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.</p>
